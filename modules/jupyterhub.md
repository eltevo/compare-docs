For all user based jupyter applications we shall use jupyterhub. 
Jupyterhub is a multi user environment for single user jupyter servers.
For the sake of modularity we aim to put the hub it self in to a docker container.
[Jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-docker) deployment setup
seems to be a neatly boundled up solution for containerized hub deployment.
