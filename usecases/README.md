# Data scooping for the field scientist

Simplified dashboard like interface for field scientist to
upload data in to the could. Preferably as simple and as
intuitive as possible on the outside and as intligent as
need be toward the database interfaces.

# An interface for designing workflows for bioinformatics

An jupyter notebook / jupyter lab  based environment for
creating workflows. Ability for the user to install needed
packages, access databases. This is meant to be a sandbox
environment for hard core coders. Integration with gitlab
and user and project filesystems is needed. 

# Data expolration and processing based on workflows for professionals

Could be simmilar environment as for the workflow design
but maybe with different base image, more tailored for data
processing and "scientific" work.

# Dashboards and interactive data exploration for the general public

This interface is for the general public and mainly intended as
a showcase. Could be dashboards or just interactive charts for
the laymen, or binder based jupyter environments for the
semi-professionals.
